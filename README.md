This repository contains code for the 2025 clouded leopard genomics paper produced by the course participants of Bioinformatics for Conservation Genomics 2023.  
We used the code in this repository as a model: [SMSC 2023 Conservation Genomics](https://github.com/SmithsonianWorkshops/SMSC_2023_Conservation_Genomics). Excellent resource for first-time paper writers.  

If there are any questions or requirements for additional code please contact me at hwillis2@gmu.edu or the PI Dr. Koepfli at kkoepfli@gmu.edu.
